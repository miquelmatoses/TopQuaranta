"""A8: API versioning — stamp the response header with the served version.

Currently every route under `/api/v1/*` returns `X-API-Version: 1`. When v2
arrives under `/api/v2/*` the same middleware will return `2` for those
routes. Clients that read the header can sanity-check they're talking to
the version they expected.

See web/api/VERSIONING.md for the policy and bump procedure.
